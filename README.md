## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for the NUS-SOC Summer Workshop Deep Learning Labs. This repository contains the work completed by our deep learning team during the first week (July 2nd to July 5th) of the summer workshop. Our focus was on understanding and implementing various deep learning techniques through a series of lectures and hands-on labs.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Labs/**  
  Contains the original lab materials provided by the teaching team, without any modifications.

- **materials_copy/**  
  Contains a copy of the original lab materials along with additional content such as trained Keras models, Transfer Learning resources for Lab 5, and the `img_scrape_v1.ipynb` web scraping script.

- **submit/**  
  Contains the completed lab submissions from our team, showcasing our work and solutions to the lab exercises.

## Weekly Schedule and Topics

### July 2nd - Deep Learning I

**Lecture 1 & Labs 1, 2**

- Long-Short Term Memory (LSTMs)
- Transformer Models
- Autoencoders (AEs)

On the first day, we explored foundational concepts in deep learning, including LSTMs, Transformer models, and Autoencoders. The labs involved practical implementations of these models.

### July 3rd - Deep Learning II

**Lecture 2 & Labs 3, 4, 5**

- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Object Detection Networks (YOLO)

The second day focused on advanced deep learning models such as GANs, CNNs, and YOLO for object detection. The labs provided hands-on experience in building and training these models.

### July 4th - Statistical Methods

**Lecture 3 & Lab 6**

- Regression
- Na√Øve Bayes Classification
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines

We delved into statistical methods and machine learning algorithms. The lab involved implementing and comparing these techniques in various scenarios.

### July 4th - Backend Communications

**Lecture 4 & Lab 7**

- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
- Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT)
- Working with Databases
- Securing MQTT with passwords

The final day of the week covered backend communications, including HTTP, MQTT, and database interactions. The lab focused on securing MQTT and integrating it with other backend services.

## Conclusion

Throughout the first week of the NUS-SOC Summer Workshop, we gained substantial knowledge and practical experience in deep learning and related technologies. Our completed labs demonstrate our understanding and ability to apply these concepts in various contexts.

We hope this repository serves as a valuable resource for anyone looking to explore the fascinating world of deep learning and its applications.
